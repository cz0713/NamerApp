# namer_app

This is my first Flutter project that where I followed a Google Codelab called "Your first Flutter app". https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first?hl=en#0

The result is a simple app that randomly generates two short words and combines them to create a unique name. There is a like feature where you can "heart" certain names and visit them later.
